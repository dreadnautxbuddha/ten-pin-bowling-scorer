# Overview
A technical exam by [Peter Paul C. Cortez](mailto:peter.cortez@cloudemployee.co.uk) for [refiine.co.uk](https://refiine.co.uk/) that replicates a ten-pin bowling scoring system. More information about the task can be found in this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mVODh4a1wm861LQ02JOe24_06We2-ll9MQvGRF7lTTg/edit).

# Usage
The script can be run using a composer command:
```shell
$ composer calculate "81,72,x,x,9/,9-"
```
Please do take note that I was only able to test this out by running the command manually using different inputs. In a real-world scenario, I'd lay out a couple of unit tests to ensure the integrity of the calculations.
